  TS/SCSS/HTML. Built on Vite. React, with Remix's SSR React Router.

Commentaries:
  This project follows the TDD philosophy. For Unit and Integration tests Vitest has been used, with additional packages like @testing-library/react-dom, react, user-event, react-dom. For End to End tests Playwright has been used(although, e2e tests are not fully done yet, as for now there is now back-end side). Additionaly, static tests are done with Eslint.

  This project also leverages some additional libraries, for example react-responsive to conditionally render react based on media query.

  Indeed, git was used widely when developing this project, as well as GitHub Actions to do End to End tests.

  In the future is planned to make a back-end side, which is going to be the last version: v1.0, and therefore this project is going to be released afterwards.
